This package delivers more APIs than the libuuid that ships with 11.3.
However, they both identify as version 1.0.  This creates possible
ambiguity at runtime.  If an application links with this library, but
the OS's default libuuid is loaded at runtime, there could well be
unresolved references.

As libuuid has not been updated in many years, it's unlikely to
receive a version bump anytime soon.  For now, we'll bump to 2.0.0, so
that there is no ambiguity at runtime.
