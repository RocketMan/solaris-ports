There were several problems with the upstream version of this code
which have been fixed here for 11.3:

1. __cxa_atexit and __cxa_finalize need to be visibility("default") so
they can be referenced by the DSOs.  They need to link only to the
application.

2. __attribute((destructor)) __do_cleanup needs to be pulled out into
a separate file to be linked to each DSO, so it will be called when
that DSO unloads.  We do this in the new cxa_cleanup_*.  __do_cleanup
for the application invokes all remaining destructors.

3. The magic symbol __dso_handle doesn't seem to work correctly on
11.3, as its value is not initialized to its address as expected.

Problems 1 and 2 are easily resolved.  To work around problem 3, we
call __cxa_finalize using the address rather than relying on the value.
