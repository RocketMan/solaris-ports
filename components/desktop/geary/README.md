## GNOME Geary e-mail application

This is a very good e-mail companion to GNOME Web/epiphany.  However,
the upstream version number recently went from zero-dot to 3.32.0;
this may not be production-ready code, and you may experience some
rough edges.

## Dependencies

You will need the WebKitGTK+ from this repo (2.22.3 or later), rather than
the one from the userland gate.

As well, you will need to update your vala with the latest vapi files
for WebKit.  You can get the current vala files from the GNOME vala repo.
